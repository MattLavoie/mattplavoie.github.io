            <p>I am honored to be asked back to speak again at UCF for the Technology and Human Interaction class. This event is not open or public, but if you are in the class I look forward to speaking with you, and I may share a presentation with all of you on the internet afterwards.</p>

              Problems, Assumptions, and Design Thinking
            </strong>
            <p>When we treat assumptions as fact, we destroy the design thinking process and our ability to identify the true problems we are trying to solve. Come with me on a journey through a true story where we will see this happen first hand and learn how to avoid it.</p>
            <p>I love BarCamp, and this will be the third year in a row I plan on speaking there. <strong>You should speak there too!</strong> BarCamp in an "Unconference" which means the agenda is made the morning of. Come with something you want to speak about, I'd love to hear it.</p>

              UX Advocacy - Buy in and Beyond
            </strong>
            <p>We all want to leverage UX Design in our process at work, but often we don't feel that it is a luxury we can afford. Or worse, we are not able to convince those we work with why it is so worth investing in.</p>

            <p>In this talk we will discuss the challenges with championing for UX Design, why the data doesn't seem to make a difference, and how you can approach trying to convince your boss and your peers. We will dive into the benefits you get from buy in, why it's worth doing, and how to approach going beyond by creating a culture that values human centered design at its core.</p>

              What would you budget to hire someone with precognition?
            </strong>
            <p>
              If we could, we would certainly fill this job. User Experience design and research very much can show you how successful a product or feature will be before you release it. In this 5 minute lightning talk at Ignite Orlando I will show you why you can't afford not to invest in UX.

              You don't need a designer to test your UX
            </strong>
            <p>
              Often with startups or small teams you don't have a UX designer on your team. If you are working on a side project or hacking something together you almost certainly don't. But you can still get huge value out of a small time investment by testing your product with users.
            </p>
            <p>
              From guerilla usability testing to more in depth research, come learn the tools you need to know to reduce the risk of your project failing and gain confidence in your decisions.
